# Skill: deep-search-consumer

This skill is intentionally minimal. “Consume deep-search artifacts” guidance is **passive context**:
- `@.cursor/guides/resolve-workflow.md`
- `@.cursor/guides/verify-checklist.md`

Use a prior deep-search run as canonical portable context:
- treat `ARCHITECTURE-REPORT.md` as the E2E map
- only re-search when stale or **NOT FOUND**
- re-pin non-local hops via Octocode (definition + implementation + boundary)
