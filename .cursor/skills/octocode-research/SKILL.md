# Octocode Research Skill 🛰️

This skill is intentionally minimal. Critical Octocode rules are **passive context**:
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/010-octocode-mandate.mdc`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/001-proof-discipline.mdc`

Use `/octocode/research` to resolve any non-local symbol with:
- **definition + implementation + boundary** (repo/path + line range + snippet)

Log results to the kit’s evidence artifact (kit-specific; see shared mandate for examples).
