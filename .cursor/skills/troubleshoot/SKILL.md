# Troubleshoot Skill 🐛

This skill is intentionally minimal. Troubleshooting guidance is **passive context**:
- `@.cursor/guides/tool-selection.md`
- `@.cursor/guides/request-id-tracing.md`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/mcp-s-mandate.mdc`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/octocode-mandate.mdc`

Use it as a pointer: gather runtime evidence (DevTools first, BrowserMCP fallback), trace request IDs via root cause analysis, use MCP-S for context/observability, and Octocode for cross-repo proof.
