# Testing

BDD tests that follow your codebase's patterns. **Discovers existing test patterns first**, then generates tests that fit.

**When to use:** Adding tests for a feature using the repo's actual testing stack.

**Key principle:** Discovery before resolution — scan the repo for existing tests to imitate before reaching for external tools.
