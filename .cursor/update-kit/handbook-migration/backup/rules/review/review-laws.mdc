# Deep-Review Laws

- Code health + consistency matter (follow existing patterns).
- Conformance is mandatory: `/review.conform` must produce CONFORMANCE.md before publish.
- Impact Sweep is mandatory for contract-shaped changes: CONSUMER-MATRIX.md required.
- Shared discipline applies:
  - `@.cursor/rules/shared/proof-discipline.mdc`
  - `@.cursor/rules/shared/octocode-mandate.mdc`
  - `@.cursor/rules/shared/mcp-s-mandate.mdc`
- Never publish before verify: `/review.publish` requires PASS `/review.verify`.
- Publish output must be SIMPLE:
  1) HIGH / MODERATE / LOW issues
  2) short summary of what was done
  3) user options: Fix now / Ignore with rationale / Escalate owner / Add tests / Add rollout/guardrails
