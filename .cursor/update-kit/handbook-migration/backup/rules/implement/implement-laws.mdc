# Deep-Implement Laws

## Shared references (passive context)
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/workflow-primitives.mdc`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/proof-discipline.mdc`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/octocode-mandate.mdc`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/mcp-s-mandate.mdc`

- Plan-first: no code edits before `/implement.plan`.
- Deep-search is canonical: always anchor scope + dependencies in the deep-search artifacts.
- Verify-before-publish: `/implement.publish` requires a passing `/implement.verify`.
- Cross-repo resolution: any non-local symbol must be resolved via `/octocode/research` (def + impl + boundary).
- Keep diffs minimal: no drive-by refactors unless explicitly requested in spec.
