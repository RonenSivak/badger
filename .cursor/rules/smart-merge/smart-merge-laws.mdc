# Smart Merge Laws 🚨

- **Plan-first:** no simulate without `MERGE-SPEC.md` + `MERGE-PLAN.md`.
- **Simulate-first:** do not “real merge” until simulation is done.
- **No publish before verify:** `/smart-merge.publish` requires PASS in `/smart-merge.verify`.
- **Proof over vibes:** any “this should work” claim must point to code.
- **NOT FOUND discipline:** missing info must include searches + scope.
