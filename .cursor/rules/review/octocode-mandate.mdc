# Octocode Mandate

Trigger `/octocode/research` immediately when ANY is true:
- import comes from external package not in the current workspace
- you hit generated code (proto-generated/dist/*.pb.ts) and need the source contract
- you can’t show implementation within 2 hops locally
- you’re relying on an SDK/client wrapper and need the generator source + runtime boundary

Octocode proof requirement:
- definition snippet (repo/path + lines)
- implementation snippet (repo/path + lines)
- side-effect boundary snippet (network/persistence/render/throw)

If Octocode can’t find it:
- NOT FOUND + exact queries + scope + closest candidates
