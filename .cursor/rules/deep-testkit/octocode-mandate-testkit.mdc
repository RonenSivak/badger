# Octocode Mandate (Testkit) 🛰️

A symbol is “non-local” if you cannot prove its implementation within the current package quickly.

Mandatory `/octocode/research` triggers:
- any import from `@wix/*` that isn’t implemented in the current workspace
- WDS testkit factories/classes you rely on (prove canonical usage)
- any shared BaseDriver / shared driver helper you plan to reuse
- ambassador builders / generated client helpers

Rule:
- local search is only hop-1 discovery
- cross-repo proof MUST be done via `/octocode/research`
- paste queries + proof snippets into `MCP-EVIDENCE.md`
