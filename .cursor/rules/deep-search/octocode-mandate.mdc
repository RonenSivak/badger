# Octocode Mandate 🛰️ (Non-Negotiable)

## When Octocode is REQUIRED
Run **`/octocode/research`** as soon as any of these triggers appear:
- external import (`@wix/*`) not implemented in the current workspace
- service facade (`documentServices.*`, `viewerServices.*`, `platformServices.*`)
- implementation not found within 2 local hops
- generated artifacts (`proto-generated`, `dist`, `*.pb.ts`)
- SDK signals:
  - `@wix/ambassador-*`
  - imports from `.../rpc` or `.../types`
  - `ctx.ambassador.request(...)`
- Metro signals:
  - “metro”, “package generation”, “fqdn”, `(.wix.api.entity)`, “platformization”

## What Octocode must return (minimum)
For each required symbol:
- **Definition**: repo/path + lines + snippet
- **Implementation**: repo/path + lines + snippet
- **Boundary**: a real side-effect snippet (network/persist/render/throw)

## SDK Generation Chain Rule
If `@wix/ambassador-*` (or equivalent SDK) appears, you must also Octocode-resolve:
- source IDL (proto/openapi/graphql)
- generator trigger/config (“package generation”)
- runtime transport implementation (auth/baseUrl/retries + execution)
- types generation proof

## Logging requirement
All queries and excerpts must be appended to:
`.cursor/deep-search/<feature>/octocode-queries.md`

If Octocode is unavailable:
- downgrade claims to **NOT FOUND**
- list the exact intended queries + scope that would have been searched
