# Deep-Implement Laws

- Plan-first: no code edits before `/implement.plan`.
- Deep-search is canonical: always anchor scope + dependencies in the deep-search artifacts.
- Verify-before-publish: `/implement.publish` requires a passing `/implement.verify`.
- Proof-first: every new claim needs repo/path + lines + snippet.
- Connectivity required: edges must be backed by import/call/binding evidence, not naming similarity.
- Cross-repo resolution: any non-local symbol must be resolved via `/octocode/research` (def + impl + boundary).
- Missing items: MUST be `NOT FOUND` with exact searches + scope.
- Keep diffs minimal: no drive-by refactors unless explicitly requested in spec.
