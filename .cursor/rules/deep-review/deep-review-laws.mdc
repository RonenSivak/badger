# Deep-Review Laws

- Never publish before verification: `/deep-review.publish` requires PASSing `/deep-review.verify`.
- Impact Sweep is mandatory: `/deep-review.impact` must produce CONSUMER-MATRIX.md for any contract-shaped change.
- Proof-first: every claim needs repo/path + lines + snippet.
- Connectivity required: claims must be backed by import/call/route-binding evidence, not naming similarity.
- Cross-repo: use `/octocode/research` for all non-local symbols (def + impl + boundary).
- MCP-S required: classify every new abstraction/symbol; docs hints must be proven in code.
- Missing items: NOT FOUND + exact searches + scope.
- Unlimited iteration: keep running MCP-S + Octocode until resolved or NOT FOUND.
