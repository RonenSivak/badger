# Octocode Mandate 🛰️

Use `/octocode/research` whenever:
- symbol is imported from a package not in the current workspace
- you hit generated code (proto-generated, dist, *.pb.ts)
- you hit service facades (documentServices.*, viewerServices.*, platformServices.*)
- you can’t show the implementation within 2 local hops

For each such symbol, Octocode must produce:
- definition (repo/path + lines + snippet)
- implementation (repo/path + lines + snippet)
- side-effect boundary snippet (network/persist/render/throw)
