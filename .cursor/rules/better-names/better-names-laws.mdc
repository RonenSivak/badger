# Better-Names Laws

## Law 1: Analyze Before Execute

**NEVER** execute a rename without completing the analyze step.
- LSP analysis must complete
- String reference search must complete
- Cross-package check must complete (if exported)

## Law 2: Verify Before Commit

**NEVER** commit rename changes without verification passing:
- `tsc --noEmit` must pass
- Tests must pass
- ESLint must pass
- No orphaned string references

## Law 3: Convention Compliance

All new names MUST follow TypeScript naming conventions:
- Variables/functions: camelCase
- Classes/interfaces/types/enums: PascalCase
- Module constants: UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- No `I` prefix on interfaces
- No `Type` suffix on type aliases

## Law 4: Semantic Validation

Before execute, verify:
- No name collision in scope
- No shadowing of outer scope
- Not a reserved keyword

## Law 5: NOT FOUND Discipline

If a symbol cannot be located:
- Record as `NOT_FOUND: <symbol>`
- Do NOT proceed with rename for that symbol
- Report in publish step

## Law 6: String Reference Integrity

All string references must be updated:
- dataHooks type parameters
- Test descriptions (describe/it blocks)
- Comments and JSDoc
- Config file references

Verify with grep after execute.
