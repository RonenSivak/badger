# MDC Frontmatter Guard

For every `.mdc` created:
- Must include frontmatter with:
  - `description`
  - `alwaysApply`
  - `globs`
- Command files must live in `.cursor/commands/`
- Rule files must live in `.cursor/rules/`
- Skill files must live in `.cursor/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`

References:
- If a command delegates to `/x.y`, the file `.cursor/commands/x.y.mdc` must exist.
- If a command claims a rule is enforced, that rule file must exist.
