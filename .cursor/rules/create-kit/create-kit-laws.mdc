# Create-Kit Laws

- Never publish before verify: `/create-kit.publish` requires PASS from `/create-kit.verify`.
- Plan first: `/create-kit.plan` must exist and generate FILE-MAP before scaffolding. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}
- Modular by default: prefer multiple smaller commands over one huge command to reduce context loss. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}
- Verifiable outputs: every kit should include at least one verification gate step. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}
