# Proof Discipline ✅ (Shared)

## Core Rule (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

> **If you can't cite it, you can't claim it.**

## Anti-Hallucination (CRITICAL)

Proofs MUST come from tools retrieved **in THIS session**:
- ✅ Read tool → actual file content
- ✅ Grep/Search → actual search results
- ✅ Octocode → actual cross-repo retrieval
- ✅ MCP-S → actual Slack/Jira/Docs results
- ❌ "I know this from training" → NOT PROOF
- ❌ "I remember seeing" → NOT PROOF
- ❌ "This is how it typically works" → NOT PROOF

## Proof Format (REQUIRED)

Every non-trivial claim must include:

```
**Proof**: `repo/path:line` (Tool: <tool name>)
```<snippet from tool output>
```
```

## Hypothesis Discipline

If you haven't verified via tool/code proof:

1. **Mark as hypothesis**: `⚠️ HYPOTHESIS (unverified): <theory>`
2. **State verification needed**: "Requires: [code search | Slack | runtime test]"
3. **NEVER present hypothesis as conclusion**

### Anti-pattern (WRONG)
> "The issue is X" → states conclusion without proof

### Correct pattern
> "⚠️ HYPOTHESIS: The issue might be X. Verifying..."
> → runs verification tool
> "✅ CONFIRMED: The issue is X"
> **Proof**: `repo/path:line` (Tool: Read) → `<snippet>`

## Connectivity Requirement

When asserting E2E hops, prove the edge connects:
- import → usage (show both lines)
- call site → implementation (show call + definition)
- route/RPC binding → handler (show config + handler)
- cross-repo hop → Octocode proof (definition + implementation + boundary)

## NOT FOUND Discipline

If you cannot prove something:
- Mark it **NOT FOUND**
- Include **exact searches** tried (3+ variations required)
- Include **scope searched** (repos/packages/paths)

```
**NOT FOUND**: <what was sought>
**Searches**:
1. `<query 1>` in `<scope>` → 0 results
2. `<query 2>` in `<scope>` → 0 results
3. `<query 3>` in `<scope>` → 0 results
```

## "Exists" is NOT Proof

- "File exists" ≠ "Edge is connected"
- "Name matches" ≠ "Same symbol/contract"
- "Pattern similar" ≠ "Same root cause"
- "I saw it before" ≠ "Retrieved this session"

## Verification Gate

Before publishing, complete proof certification per [verify-checklist.md](../../guides/verify-checklist.md).

**If certification incomplete → DO NOT PUBLISH.**
