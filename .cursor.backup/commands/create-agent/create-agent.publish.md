# /create-agent.publish — Publish

Print a concise report:
- Target repo root
- Files created/updated (from FILE-MAP)
- Where to edit future instructions (AGENTS.md + any rules)
- How to extend safely (add docs to index, avoid large pasted guides)

Write `<repo-root>/.cursor/agent-setup/REPORT.md` with the same content.
