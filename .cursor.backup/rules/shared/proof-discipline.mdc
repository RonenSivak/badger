# Proof Discipline ✅ (Shared)

## Proof-first (non-negotiable)
Every **non-trivial** claim must be backed by evidence, not naming similarity.

Minimum proof format:
- **repo/path + line range + snippet**

## Hypothesis Discipline (CRITICAL)
**NEVER state a conclusion without proof.** If you haven't verified via MCP-S or code proof:

1. **Mark as HYPOTHESIS**: `⚠️ HYPOTHESIS (unverified): <your theory>`
2. **State verification needed**: "Requires: [Slack search | code proof | runtime test]"
3. **Do NOT present hypotheses as root causes or solutions**

### Anti-pattern (WRONG)
> "The issue is X" → states conclusion without proof

### Correct pattern
> "⚠️ HYPOTHESIS: The issue might be X. Verifying via Slack/code..."
> → runs verification
> "✅ CONFIRMED: The issue is X (proof: Slack thread from @user, code at path:line)"

## Connectivity requirement
When you assert an E2E hop, you must prove the edge connects via code, e.g.:
- import → usage
- call site → implementation
- route/RPC binding → handler
- cross-repo hop → Octocode proof (definition + implementation + boundary)

## NOT FOUND discipline
If you cannot prove something:
- mark it **NOT FOUND**
- include **exact searches** tried (patterns/keywords)
- include **scope searched** (repos/packages/paths)

## "Exists" is not enough
- "File exists" ≠ "Edge is connected"
- "Name matches" ≠ "Same symbol/contract"
- "Pattern similar" ≠ "Same root cause"
