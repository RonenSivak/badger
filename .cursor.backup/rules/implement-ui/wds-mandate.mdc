# WDS Mandate

## MUST Call First

Before creating, building, or implementing ANY component:

```
MUST call getComponentsList from wix-design-system-mcp
```

This gives you:
- Available components with descriptions
- Dos and don'ts for each component
- Context for informed decisions

## NOT FOUND Flow (STRICT)

When a requested component is NOT in the WDS list:

### Step 1: STOP
- Do NOT generate any code
- Do NOT assume what the component should be

### Step 2: INFORM
Tell user:
> "X is not an official Wix Design System component."

### Step 3: ASK
> "Would you like me to search wix-private and wix-playground repositories for similar implementations?"

### Step 4: WAIT
Do not proceed without user confirmation.

### Step 5: SEARCH (if confirmed)
Use octocode with:
- `owner="wix-private"` 
- `owner="wix-playground"`

Show real examples and patterns found.

## NEVER

- ❌ Generate code for non-existent WDS components without checking
- ❌ Create components based on assumptions
- ❌ Skip asking permission to search
- ❌ Hallucinate component implementations

## For Existing WDS Components

When component IS in the list:
1. Get props with `getComponentProps`
2. Get examples with `getComponentExamples` if complex
3. Use `verify` tool to type-check JSX before applying
4. Offer real examples from wix-private/wix-playground automatically
