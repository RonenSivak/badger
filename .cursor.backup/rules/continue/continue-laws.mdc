# /continue Laws

## Shared references (passive context)
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/proof-discipline.mdc`
- `@.cursor/rules/shared/workflow-primitives.mdc`

## Purpose

`/continue` resumes work from a session memory dump. The memory dump is the source of truth for what happened previously.

## Laws (MANDATORY)

### 1) No assumptions beyond memory
- Do not invent missing context.
- If the dump is incomplete, mark gaps explicitly and ask minimal clarifying questions.

### 2) Verify pointers
- If the dump references files/paths, validate they exist before relying on them.
- If a pointer doesn’t exist: record **NOT FOUND** and proceed accordingly.

### 3) Preserve constraints
- If the dump indicates MCPs were missing/skipped, preserve degraded-mode constraints.
- Do not silently “upgrade” assumptions.

### 4) Delegate to canonical workflows
If the next steps indicate a Badger workflow should be used (e.g. `/deep-search`, `/troubleshoot`, `/review`, `/rnd`), run that orchestrator instead of re-creating the workflow inside `/continue`.

### 5) Safety on high-risk actions
If the next steps include risky operations (git history rewrite, deploy, large refactor), reconfirm intent and run appropriate verification gates before proceeding.
